# FiveM / RedM performance and network optimization

Specialist skill for **resmon CPU** and **network bytes**. Not a general implementation or natives encyclopedia.

Load references only when the task needs them. Do not preload all three.

| File | Open when |
|---|---|
| [references/profiling.md](references/profiling.md) | Measuring, hitch type, resmon, profiler, `neteventlog`, verification |
| [references/fivem-networking.md](references/fivem-networking.md) | Events, latent, msgpack/JSON, routing/`-1`, state bags, callbacks, bandwidth math |
| [references/lua-hotpaths.md](references/lua-hotpaths.md) | Threads, `Wait`, natives, pools, alloc, NUI, `GetPlayers`, SQL loops |

Unknown native signature → `fivem-natives-skill`. OneSync entity exploits / ownership policy → existing project security skill if present; otherwise validate net IDs and never trust the client.

---

## Goal

Lower CPU **and** network traffic **and** event spam **and** payload size, with correct sync and unchanged gameplay.

A resource at `0.00ms` that still floods events is not optimized. A quiet net log with a `Wait(0)` pool scan is not optimized.

Do not optimize blindly. Do not invent measurements. Do not weaken server validation to save bytes.

---

## Workflow

1. Identify game (FiveM / RedM / shared) and side (client / server / NUI).
2. Measure, or mark estimates. Open `references/profiling.md`.
3. Grep the checklist below. Classify each hit: CPU, network, or both; Critical / High / Medium / Low.
4. Open the matching reference **before** proposing a fix.
5. Preserve gameplay, sync, routing buckets, permissions, exports, NUI, framework state.
6. Report before/after with **measured** vs **estimated** labeled.

---

## Defaults (always on)

- Longest safe sleep. `Wait(0)` only for true per-frame work.
- Event-driven over polling when the state is observable.
- Smallest valid audience. `-1` only when every client must receive it.
- Send deltas, not whole player/inventory blobs.
- Net events are msgpack. Extra `json.encode` is CPU (and a fat string if you send it).
- Latent events only for large, non-latency-critical payloads.
- Cache natives for this tick; do not cache values that must stay live.
- After any perf change, server still validates `source`, permissions, amounts, ownership, distance, bucket, cooldowns.
- Capture `local src = source` before yields.

---

## Grep checklist

Search the whole resource, both sides:

- `CreateThread` / `Citizen.CreateThread` / `while true`
- `Wait(0)` / `Wait(1)` / `Wait(5)` / `Wait(10)`
- `TriggerServerEvent` / `TriggerClientEvent` / `TriggerLatent`
- `TriggerClientEvent` with `-1`
- `RegisterNetEvent` / `AddEventHandler` / `TriggerEvent`
- `GetGamePool` / `GetActivePlayers` / `GetPlayers`
- `json.encode` / `json.decode`
- `SendNUIMessage`
- `MySQL` / `oxmysql` / `.query` / `.query.await`
- `GlobalState` / `.state` / `AddStateBagChangeHandler`
- `lib.callback` / `emitNet`

For each event: local vs C→S vs S→C; frequency; payload shape; recipient set; inside a loop or not.

---

## Priority

**Critical** — frame-level `Trigger*Event`, `GetGamePool` every frame, large JSON every tick, `-1` broadcast of fat data.

**High** — frequent loops, unnecessary broadcasts, large payloads, expensive natives, sync SQL in loops.

**Medium** — repeated allocs, redundant math, inefficient table scans.

**Low** — micro-opts resmon will not show.

Do not grind Low while Critical remains.

---

## Before editing

1. Understand architecture, event consumers, client/server boundary.
2. Search the **entire** resource (and dependents) before deleting an event. It may be used from another file or resource.
3. Check exports, callbacks, NUI, framework integrations, state bags.
4. Do not change behavior of inventory, money, permissions, entity ownership, or routing buckets unless the user asked.

If an optimization must change behavior, say so explicitly.
